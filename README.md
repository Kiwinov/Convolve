# Convolve: TensileTensors
All data and code created for the Inter-IIT Convolve competition.

## About
The objective of the hackathon was to identify anomalies (fraudsters) from a collection of transaction history data of different consumer bank customers. Each row corresponded to a bank account with columns describing the details regarding the account such as the list of all transactions, demography, etc.

We finally achieved an accuracy 99.535% and an F1 score of 0.886 in identifying fraudsters after using several models such as RandomForests, SVM, Bagging, CATBoost and XGBoost.
